In the article, we presented the ideas and discussed the algorithms, but skipped important implementation details best covered in a notebook with code. Those details are dicussed here.    \n",

They may be easily extracted, extended and integrated into production systems. Some advanced extensions particularly important in a production context are discussed in the [appendices](https://github.com/differential-machine-learning/appendices/).\n",

On Google Colab, the correct version of TensorFlow is automatically selected, and all the necessary libraries are preinstalled. All you need is *enable GPU support*: menu runtime/change runtime type and select hardware accelerator GPU.\n",

For modern deep learning and best practices, we refer e.g. to [Goodfellow and al's Deep Learning Book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) or [Andrew Ng's deep learning lectures](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning). \n",

        "The outer training loop optimizes the weights of neural approximators for a number of epochs (complete sweeps of the training set). We applied the recent [one-cycle learning rate schedule](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.09820) of Leslie Smith and found that it considerably accelerates and stabilizes the training of neural networks. 100 epochs is more than sufficient in most practical cases. A convergence and/or cross-validation test may be included for early stopping. Typical training takes around a second on a decent GPU (longer on Colab's shared GPUs). The approximator class, defined next, holds all the necessary data and parameters, along with the TensorFlow graph and computing session."

        "The practical performance of neural networks strongly depends on implementation details, like weight initialization and optimization. Another crucial practicality is the *normalization of training data*. We refer to deep learning texbooks for a discussion of the importance of normalization. One reason is that we need hyperparameters like the learning rate schedule to remain constant over datasets. If notional was to be increased by factor 1M all things equal, gradients would be multiplied by 1M too and learning rates would have to be divided by 1M to keep things similar. Normalizing data avoids manual tinkering of hyperparameters for different datasets. All the examples in the paper: the Gaussian basket, the autocallable trade and the netting set, were all approximated with the exact same hyperparameters. This is only possible with normalized datasets. \n",

The differential weights in the cost function $\\lambda_j$ divide costs by the norm of the normalized differentials, keeping similar the magnitude of all the components of the cost.\n",

We could perform successive changes of basis, combined with filtering strategies, to feed neural networks with data orthonormal in terms of inputs *and* in terms of differentials, highlighting the most significant risk factors and filtering out the irrelevant ones. This is covered in detail in the [this appendix](https://github.com/differential-machine-learning/appendices/blob/master/App2-Preprocessing.pdf), where we discuss novel, and extremely effective data preparation algorithms, exploiting information contained in differential labels to considerably alleviate the load of training neural networks and subsequently, improve training performance and reduce sensitivity to hyperparameters. \n",

        "Instead, we **learn from samples** *a la* Lonstaff-Schwartz (or **LSM**, from Valuing American Options by Simulation: A Simple Least-Squares Approach, The Review of Financial Studies, 2001). Our inputs are simulated Markov states at some time $T_1$ (called *exposure date* in the context of regulations), labels are *payoffs* (sum of discounted cash-flows paid after $T_1$) picked on the same Monte-Carlo path, and differential labels are **pathwise derivatives** usually computed with automatic adjoint differentiation (AAD, see [textbook](https://amazon.com/Modern-Computational-Finance-Parallel-Simulations-dp-1119539455/dp/1119539455)) (although in the simple cases of Black & Scholes and Bachelier, we easily compute them explicitly).\n",

        "It follows that training sets are produced quickly, for a computation cost similar to *one* Monte-Carlo price, but we now expect the machine to learn pricing and risk functions without having ever seen a price or a delta, only samples. That training still converges to the correct pricing and risk function may be seen somewhat magical. Fortunately, Longstaff & Schwartz' idea of training on samples is backed by solid mathematics and guaranteed to converge to the true pricing function. A sketch of proof is provided [here](https://github.com/differential-machine-learning/appendices/blob/master/App1-LSM.pdf)."

        "The recent success of deep learning is largely due to their ability to break the long standing *curse of dimensionality* that breaks classic regression models in high dimension. Contrarily to classic linear models, neural networks don't regress on a fixed set of basis functions. They *learn from data* a relevant regression basis in their hidden layers, embedding a powerful dimension reduction capability in their structure. This is why deep learning succeeded in such high dimensional tasks as computer vision, where the dimension of the inputs is the number of pixels in a picture. Convolutional nets effectively learn the low dimensional features that matter to e.g. image recognition, something a classic regression model couldn't do.\n",
        "\n",
        "*Differential* machine learning also shines in high dimension, where differential labels help identify relevant features more effectively. In fact, the additional performance from differential training exponentially increases with dimension. This is why twin networks are particularly effective for learning values of complex transactions or trading books as functions of a high dimensional state. \n",
        "\n",
        "To illustrate this ability in a simple context, we extend the Black & Scholes example to a basket option written on $n$ correlated stocks. In place of the Black & Scholes model, the stocks are simulated in Bachelier's Gaussian model, where the true price of the basket option is known in closed form, and given by Bachelier's formula applied to the basket at $T_1$. Therefore, we can monitor the performance of our approximators by comparison to the correct, analytic  prices and deltas.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition, the example is particularly interesting because *the price is really a non-linear function of the one-dimensional basket*. We expect the machine to learn that from data, and twin networks achieve this a lot better than feedforward networks. The stellar results of the section 3.1 of the article demonstrate the power of differential learning. \n",
        "\n",
        "The code below follows the exact same logic as the *BlackScholes* simulator to simulate LSM samples for a basket option in a $n$-dimensional, correlated Bachlier model. The correlations, volatility and basket weights are re-generated randomly on every run, allowing to verify performance in multiple configurations. It is a direct extension of the *BlackScholes* simulator and, as such, such be rather self explanatory."

In a general case with an arbitrary schedule of complex cash-flows simulated in an arbitrarily sophisticated model, closed form differentials are not available and finite differences are far too slow. In dimension 100, every training example must be computed 101 times to estimate differentials by finite differences. In addition, differentials approximated by finite differences may not be accurate enough for the purpose of training: we don't want the optimizer chasing imprecise differentials.\n",
        "\n",
        "Introduced to finance by the ground breaking *Smoking Adjoints* (Giles and Glasserman, Risk 2006), AAD is a game changing technology allowing to compute differentials of arbitrary computations, automatically, with analytic precision, and for a computation cost of around 2 to 5 times one evaluation, depending on implementation, and *independently on the dimension of the gradient*. \n",
        "\n",
        "AAD arguably constitutes the most significant progress in computational finance of the past 20 years. It gave us real-time risk reports for complex Derivatives trading books and regulations like XVA, as well as instantaneous calibrations. It made differentials massively available for research and development in finance. Quoting the conclusion of our Wilmott piece *Computation graphs for AAD and Machine Learning parts 1, 2 and 3* (Savine, Wilmott Magazine, 2019-2020):\n",
        "\n",
        "*New implementations of AAD are pushing the limits of its efficiency, while quantitative analysts are leveraging them in unexpected ways, besides the evident application to risk sensitivities or calibration.*\n",
        "\n",
        "To a large extent, differential machine learning is another strong application of AAD. It is AAD that gave us the massive number of accurate differentials necessary to implement it, for a very cheap computation cost, and is ultimately responsible for the spectacular performance improvement. The real-world examples in the Risk paper, sections 3.2 and 3.3, were trained on AAD differential labels.\n",
        "\n",
        "The working paper or the complements do not cover AAD. Readers are referred to the (stellar) founding paper. [This textbook](https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Computational-Finance-Parallel-Simulations-dp-1119539455/dp/1119539455) provides a complete, up to date overview of AAD, its applications in finance, and a complete, professional implementation in modern C++.\n",
